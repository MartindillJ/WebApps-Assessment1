		        		<p><b>Star Wars</b> (later retitled <b>Star Wars: Episode IV â€“ A New Hope</b>) is a 1977 American epic space opera written and directed by George Lucas. It is the first film in the original Star Wars trilogy, the first Star Wars movie in general, and the beginning of the Star Wars franchise. Starring <a href="cast.html#markHamill">Mark Hamill</a>, <a href="cast.html#harrisonFord">Harrison Ford</a>, <a href="cast.html#carrieFisher">Carrie Fisher</a>, <a href="cast.html#peterCushing">Peter Cushing</a> and <a href="cast.html#alecGuinness">Alec Guinness</a>, the plot focuses on the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia (Fisher), and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star. This conflict disrupts the isolated life of farmhand Luke Skywalker (Hamill), who inadvertently purchases two droids that possess stolen architectural plans for the Death Star. When the Empire begins a destructive search for the missing droids, Skywalker accompanies Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Guinness) on a mission to return the plans to the Rebel Alliance and rescue Leia from the Death Star.</p>

		        		<p id="starClothing">Star Wars was released in theatres in the U.S. on May 25, 1977. It made $461 million in the U.S. and $314 million abroad, totaling $775 million (that's over $3 billion in 2017, adjusted for inflation). It surpassed Jaws (1975) to become the highest-grossing film of all time until the release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). When adjusted for inflation, Star Wars is the second-highest-grossing film in North America, and the third-highest-grossing film ever. It received 10 Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture), winning seven. It was among the first films to be selected as part of the U.S. Library of Congress' National Film Registry. At the time, it was the most recent film on the registry and the only one chosen from the 1970s. Its soundtrack was added to the U.S. National Recording Registry in 2004. Today, it is often regarded as one of the most important films in the history of motion pictures. It launched an industry of tie-in products, including TV series spinoffs, novels, comic books, and video games, and merchandise including toys, games and clothing.</p>
